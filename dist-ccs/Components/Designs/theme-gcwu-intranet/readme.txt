Release Note
theme-gcwu-intranet design template for codecharge studio is developped first within the demo-ccs Design folder, and copied over when ready, as a standalone contribution.

<h2>Using theme-gcwu-intranet Codecharge variant</h2>

theme-gcwu-intranet codecharge variant provides a re-usable design template to be used within YesSoftware codechargestudio 5.x Rapid Application Development (RAD) software. For more information about it, please refer to http://yessoftware.com site.

Within CodeCharge Studio, Design template (simplify called template thereafter) are a set of master pages that you can apply to web pages in your project. It provides a second level of abstraction in the User Interface design, capable of tailoring the presentation layer for various presentation needs (different organizations, internet/extranet) while keeping the same Business Logic and Data Storage design. More details about master pages are available in CodeCharge Studio.

Adding Designs to your Project
Before you can use the template provided, you must add it to your project. Adding it as a new CodeCharge Studio template first is recommended.

1. Copy the whole theme-gcwu-intranet as a new re-useable user presentation template in C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeChargeStudio5\Components\Designs or equivalent if installed elsewhere.
2. Once you start using the Design Template, you will need to merge the provided resources (languages) files (clf_en.txt, clf_fr.txt,...) with those of your application, so all the the clf text variables embedded in the template can be properly rendered in the desierd language.
