INTRODUCTION
clf and cadms demo applications has been generated using CodechargeStudio, a great and cost-effective 
Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool. Each demo has been generated with the following selectable parameters:

1. server code language: php;
2. OS: Linux (lf)

Only cadms demo requires MySQL on localhost, showcasing database driven menu-breadcrum-content viewing.
Other combinations of languages and databases are possible. See readme file in dist folder.

CLF DEMO

The clf demo showcases the default static demos page as found in wet-boew distribution, 
where each language selection requires its own separate set of menu, navigation and content pages.


CADMS DEMO

The cadms demo showcases a complete database driven clf application, that provides dynamic 
selection of languages, clf theme, navigation menu, and even site from a tightly yet decoupled 
set of re-usable html template and text based resource files.


INSTALLATION

The demos are ready to use on most LAMP server.

You need to:
1. (All) Copy the folders to your root web folder; and
2. (cadms) Install the demo SQL schema (Intranet_MySQL.sql) in your localhost based MySQL database.
3. (cadms) Modify Common.php file parameter as necessary to change default settings such as 
application username and password, MySQL port, MySQL server location,...

Warning: Like any database driven application, installation of cadms demo requires a minimum of 
security considerations before it can be operated safely.

1. Ensure MySQL is only accessible on localhost where it is installed (no remote user);
2. cadms/Common.php file contains application Access Control credentials and must be protected: 
Ensure the file is only readeable by the application owner and never through the web server.
