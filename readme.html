<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h2>Demo licensing</h2>
<p>This folder contains demo applications generated with CodeChargeStudio, distributed under MIT or GPL2 license (see each demo).</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of the demo is to showcase at least one of the new clf theme design Component, starting with the GoC intranet theme.</p>

<p>By using a Design component in CCS, a web application developer can easily distribute work on content or presentation.
Content pages are generated using CCS Application Builder or manually, and the Design component (look-and-feel) dynamically linked.
This provides the capability to develop an application where both the interface language and the theme used is dynamically defined at runtime.
It is thus possible to re-use any existing application for a multitude of specific presentation needs, such as those required 
for Government of Canada internet and intranet sites.</p>

<h2>Design Component</h2>
Using a Design Component, each CCS5 application page is generated by default into a minimum of two placeholders:
<ul>
 <dl>
  <dt>{Head}</dt>   <dd>Code that goes into the <head> section of an HTML page</dd>
  <dt>{Content}</dt><dd>Code that goes into the <body> section of an HTML page</dd>
</dl> 
</ul>

<p> Additionally, other placeholders can be defined. For WET based themes, the demo used also uses the following 
additional pre-defined placeholders:</p>
<ul>
 <dl>
  <dt>{Menu}</dt>    <dd>Code that defines the main application menu list </dd>
  <dt>{Sidebar1}</dt><dd>Code that is used for Navigation section (list or tree)</dd> 
  
</dl> 
</ul>

<h1>Why using Codechargestudio?</h1>

<p>Applications created with CodeChargeStudio can be generated for several different OS, database, and programming languages,
while preserving the same base code.</p>

<p>However, the demos provided herein have been generated for use with only one specific environment configuration: Windows Apache MySQL PHP (WAMP). 
Generation of the demo in any other combination requires (as a minimum) a licensed CodeChargeStudio application. 
Contact author if you need them in a different environment configuration (OS:Linux,IOS, dbms:Oracle,MS SQL,DB2,Access, or language:JSP, Perl,C##,InMotion,.NET).
See each demo change.log for their features and bug fixes.</p>

<h2>File structure</h2>

Directory demos-ccs contains the run-time version of each demos, generated directly from CCS. Ready-to-run as is on a lamp server.
<br>
Directory dist-ccs contains only the Design Component, required for your own application. Its content should copied into 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeChargeStudio5\Components\Designs" on your Windows IDE workstation. You will require a licensed copy 
of CodeChargeStudio to be able to generate new applications using it.

Demo Naming convention
<name>-<os>-<dbms>-<language> 	: Application name, followed by the Operating System, dbms and server-side language selected for build.

Example
ecadms-windows-mysql-php 		: application demo for the management of enterprise resource baseline and related data.
