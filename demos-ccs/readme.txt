Introduction

This folder contains demo applications generated from CodeChargeStudio, distibutede under MIT or GPL2 license.

Each demo application is generated with CodeCharge for a specific server OS, database, and language.
By default, demo provided will be generated first for use on Linux Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP) infrastructure, being the most common and open source.
Generation of the demo in any other combination requires (as a minimum) CodeChargeStudio application.

See each demo change.log for their features and bug fixes.

Each CCS demo source  folder is located in the root dist-ccs folder.
